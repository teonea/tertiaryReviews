<p>Meet the Creator:
	My name is Hannah Teonea and I founded Tertiary Reviews. The reason for creating this website is that I am a massive tripAdvisor fan and I love to read and write reviews. I believe writing reviews is something everybody should get into as it is always helpful to get a second honest, unbiased opinion. When I was looking for a course to study last year I would Google 'reviews on [insert course here]' and would often end up with no results. Not having these 'real' reviews made me feel a little apprehensive about what I was getting myself into. Studying is not cheap, so why is there a massive lack of reviews regarding tertiary study? Good running shoes are about $200 and there are endless reviews. So I have created Tertiary Reviews as I believe knowledge is power.
