	<p>
		My name is Hannah Teonea and I have created Tertiary Reviews as I believe it will help people make informed decisions. My inspiration for creating this website was tripAdvisor. I love to read and write reviews, I believe writing reviews is something everybody should get involved in as it is always helpful to get a second honest, unbiased opinion. When I was looking for a course to study last year I would Google 'reviews on [insert course here]' and would often end up with no results. Not having these 'real' reviews made me feel a little apprehensive about what I was getting myself into. Higher education is not cheap, so why is there a lack of reviews regarding tertiary study? Good running shoes are about $200 and there are endless reviews, so I have created Tertiary Reviews as I believe in giving the power to the people.
